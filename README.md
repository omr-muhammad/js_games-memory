# Memory Game

In this memory game, players are presented with a grid of face-down cards. The objective is to find matching pairs by flipping over two cards at a time. Here are some key features:

- **Timer**: The game includes a timer that starts when the player begins the game. The challenge is to complete the game as quickly as possible.
- **Number of Tries**: Players have a limited number of tries (or moves) to find all the matching pairs. If they exceed this limit, the game ends.
- **Win Condition**: The game ends when all pairs are successfully matched or when the player runs out of tries or time.
